Overview
This project is designed to be a text editor accessible in a web browser. It utilizes IndexedDB for data storage, ensuring content persistence even without an internet connection. It employs the idb package, a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API, to facilitate efficient data storage and retrieval.

User Story
As a developer, I want to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection so that I can reliably retrieve them for later use.

Acceptance Criteria
Upon opening the application, a client-server folder structure is visible.
Running npm run start from the root directory initiates the backend and serves the client.
JavaScript files are bundled using webpack.
Webpack plugins generate HTML, service worker, and manifest files.
The text editor functions seamlessly in the browser, supporting next-gen JavaScript.
IndexedDB immediately creates a database storage upon opening the text editor.
Content entered in the text editor and clicked off the DOM window is saved in IndexedDB.
Reopening the text editor retrieves the saved content from IndexedDB.
Clicking the "Install" button allows downloading the web application as an icon on the desktop.
The web application has a registered service worker using workbox.
Static assets are precached on loading, along with subsequent pages and static assets.
Proper build scripts for a webpack application are in place for deployment.
